We believed the surface world extinct, yet here they thrive, ignorant of our technologies like protein printers or television screens.

Known among his neighbors for his eccentric interests, Bennett claims he's been experimenting with a strange, beeping box he found buried near the village a decade ago. He insists it's not just scrap metal. His description sounds eerily similar to our old communication devices. Could it be a lost relic from another Stratohaven?

Her husband, now an old man, guards her possessions like precious treasures. From her computer, we extract the coordinates - they lead to a location that's not on any of our maps. It's time to explore these unknown coordinates and unravel the mysteries they hold.					0	0	0	0
	No	Control Room	Wasteland	0.00	2					Deck 10 cards	The coordinates lead us not to another city in the clouds, but to a secluded control room nestled on a lesser-known mountain. The room is filled with old technology and screens, some still flickering with life. Stasia's digital logs reveal she was a guardian of sorts, the most recent in a long line of clones, maintaining the technology that oversees these mountaintop settlements. The screens show several settlements like Stratohaven, yet ours is the only one with the gate marked 'open.' The question lingers in the air: If Stasia died before Stratohaven was unlocked, who unlocked our city, and why? We hope the Stratolink printplans we discovered will lead to answers.					0	0	0	0
