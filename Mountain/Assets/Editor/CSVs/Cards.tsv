Why risk the barren lands below? But today, something changed. In the distance, bursts of light pierced the sky - fireworks, akin to those in our old TV shows. Are we truly alone?

The room is filled with old technology and screens, some still flickering with life. Stasia's digital logs reveal she was a guardian of sorts, the most recent in a long line of clones, maintaining the technology that oversees these mountaintop settlements. The screens show several settlements like Stratohaven, yet ours is the only one with the gate marked 'open.'
