  OnRevealText: 'The coordinates lead us not to another city in the clouds, but to
    a secluded control room nestled on a lesser-known mountain. The room is filled
    with old technology and screens, some still flickering with life. Stasia''s digital
    logs reveal she was a guardian of sorts, the most recent in a long line of clones,
    maintaining the technology that oversees these mountaintop settlements. The screens
    show several settlements like Stratohaven, yet ours is the only one with the
    gate marked ''open.'' The question lingers in the air: If Stasia died before
    Stratohaven was unlocked, who unlocked our city, and why? We hope the Stratolink
    printplans we discovered will lead to answers.'
